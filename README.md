Crowdfunding is the act of raising funds from individuals through social networking services for small-scale donations or investments.

There is a clear trend in consumer demand for personalized items, which has positively influenced the growth of crowdfunding markets. 

However, challenges remain in ensuring the reliability of services, as funding is made possible even for incomplete or prototype product ideas. 

To address this issue, our team aimed to provide a crowdfunding platform that is **reliable**, **safe** and **interactive** for users. 

Our **Crofle** service:
1. Provides reliability to customers with practical information than photos. 
2. Enhances security with funding eligibility restricted through AI & admin review
3. Provides real-time two-way communication between sellers & consumers

* Two-server configuration setup using Naver Cloud Platform (NCP)
* Nginx acts as a proxy server, routing client requests to the Vue.js and media servers
* In the private subnet, MySQL, Redis, and the Spring application are running in Docker containers, designed in a way that prevents direct external access

[**FRONT-END CODE REPO 🔗**](https://github.com/yejinaCodes/Live-CrowdFunding-Project)


[**BACK-END CODE REPO 🔗**](https://github.com/yejinaCodes/Live-CrowdFunding-Frontend)


By managing the frontend and backend repositories separately, parallel work was possible, and independent deployment and scaling were possible


Through Continuous Integration, code changes were shared and integrated quickly, minimizing code conflicts.

## AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT






## RETROSPECTION

* I felt a lack of experience in simplifying backend architecture and writing clean code with design patterns. However, I plan to continue developing my skills through hands-on experience and learning to write more efficient and structured code.
* The importance of the dashboard became clear to me, as various statistics can help provide better services for managing crowdfunding projects. I want to further my knowledge in using data-driven insights to improve services.
* The successful completion of the project was largely due to continuous communication and collaboration with the team. This experience highlighted the importance of teamwork.
