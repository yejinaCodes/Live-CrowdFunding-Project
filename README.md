There is a clear trend in consumer demand for personalized items, which has positively influenced the growth of crowdfunding markets. 

However, challenges remain in ensuring the reliability of services, as funding is made possible even for incomplete or prototype product ideas. 

To address this issue, our team aimed to provide a crowdfunding platform that is **reliable**, **safe** and **interactive** for users. 

Our **Crofle** service:
1. Provides reliability to customers with practical information than photos. 
2. Enhances security with funding eligibility restricted through AI & admin review
3. Provides real-time two-way communication between sellers & consumers
